# Biography: 
My name is Chance Woudenberg and I am a Visual Communication Design major at Eastern Washington University. Some of my hobbies aside from design or the arts are houseplants and fish keeping! I love to travel, and currently visit one National Park a year with the plan to visit as many as I can! A fun fact about me/my life is that my boyfriend and I have the same first name.
