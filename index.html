      <h1>About Me</h1>
      </div>
  <p> I initially discovered my love for design while designing my high school yearbook. From there, my passion for design has continued to grow! I am currently majoring in VCD, minoring in Business Administration, and pursuing a certification in UX/UI Design at Eastern Washington University. 
    <br></br>
    In the future I plan on working in the design field, but I haven't decided which specific area of design I'd like to pursue. Recently I have taken a liking to UX/UI design, which may end up being the specific career field I choose to pursue. Time will tell!
    <br></br>
     In addition to design, my other passions include travel and collecting/growing rare tropical plants. I currently own over 200 houseplants, both common and rare. When I travel, I like to visit new places and have new experiences. Since I'm in college and don't have a lot of money, we keep our trips low-budget and visit National Parks. By low-budget, I mean that we sleep in the back of my car and survive off of muffins and sandwiches we make from our ice chest. </p>
